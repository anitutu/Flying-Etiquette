# Flying Etiquette
## Is it rude to wake a passenger up if you are trying to go to the bathroom?
I chose the question above because I often find myself sitting in the middle seat on flights with the person sitting next to me in the aisle asleep. I always try my best to hold off using the bathroom because I am reluctant to wake them up. I was curious to see whether people found it rude to wake up passengers when trying to use the bathroom or if most people were okay with it. Using the data from the FiveThirtyEight survey, my chart reveals that a majority of respondents, 63%, did not find it at all rude to wake up passengers to use the restroom on a flight. Only 4% of respondents found it very rude to wake up a passenger to use the bathroom. Safe to say, I was delighted by the results.
